If you just want to view the notebook go to this link:

https://nbviewer.org/github/Sharkful/QuantumComputingNotes/blob/main/04/JuliaQuantum_04.ipynb

If you want to run the notebook yourself, the first step is to download Julia! (It's great, trust me)
Go to this link to get Version 1.8.5:
https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/winnt/x64/1.8/julia-1.8.5-win64.exe

The preferred method of working with the notebook is to use VSCode!
1. Install the Jupyter extension in VSCode
2. Install the Julia extension in VSCode
3. Open the notebook file and run!

You can also have julia install it's own jupyter and launch a notebook in your browser using the script "browsernotebook.jl"
Type:

julia browsernotebook.jl

And it will install the notebook tools, and ask if it can install the necessary jupyter tools to run the notebook. 
After a bit, it will launch in your browser.
